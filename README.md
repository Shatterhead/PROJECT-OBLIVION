OBLIVION 1.0 REVIEW
Project Oblivion is a small sustaning boat, which is tied to a rope. It floats or river and it should make power, sustain systems. Oblivion 1.0 was the first
boat existed. It was make from Styrofoam and glued with mecol. It had a wooden stick pointing to the sky. On stick there was banner with its name. The banner 
was a piece of paper with plastic around, for protection. It also consisted a easter egg, inside of candle, which I dedicated my life to. Oblivion 2 was also made from styrofoam, but the shape was like a real ship.
